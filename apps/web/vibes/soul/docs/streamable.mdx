## Background

As you read through the API Reference documentation for individual components, you'll notice that we often define props to have a type of `Streamable<T>`.
For example, if you looked at the API Reference for the [ProductList](/docs/soul/product-list) component, you'll see that the required `products` prop
is defined as a `Streamable<ListProduct[]>`.

Many of our components, including `ProductList`, encapsulate UI like loading and error states taking advantage of React Suspense and error boundaries.
`Streamable` allows the consumers of the component to define how their data is fetched (e.g., what API to request data from) while delegating the UI
concerns to the component. When using React Server Components and React's streaming server renderer, it also handles streaming the data from the server
to the client leveraging Suspense, hence the name.
