### FileInput Component

We've added a new [`FileInput`](/docs/soul/file-input) component that supports drag & drop, progress tracking, and file validation.

<Preview componentName="file-input-example" size="sm" />

### Launch of VIBES CLI

We're excited to announce the launch of the [VIBES CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vibes) â€“ a command-line tool for installing VIBES components directly into your project.

#### Key features:

- Smart package manager detection (pnpm, yarn, bun, npm)
- Interactive dependency installation with user prompts
- Intelligent component resolution with automatic dependency handling
- Flexible installation options with `--dry-run` and `--no-install` flags

#### Get started:

```bash
# Install a component
npx vibes@latest add button

# Install with dependencies
npx vibes@latest add navigation

# Preview changes without installing
npx vibes@latest add accordion --dry-run
```
