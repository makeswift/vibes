title: 'Welcome to Soul'
description: 'Building composable web solutions is like art: there are no rules, just countless mediums (technologies). It is within the eye of the artist (engineer) to ‘paint’ these technologies and bring them together into a cohesive product that is greater than the sum of its parts. This was the fundamental foundational principle of Soul–it’s an opinionated yet completely customizable set of components to help you build a proper store grounded in proper design.'

## Why we built Soul

We have always felt there to be a unique gap in the tools and frameworks in the ecommerce space, which is why we built Soul–a way to create, customize, and ship beautiful storefronts in a fraction of the development effort while ensuring great user experience using robust technologies.

When building ecommerce storefronts, the issues and contentions that come with building composable websites are greatly exacerbated, because ecommerce is extremely demanding when it comes to features, APIs, user experience, and performance can directly impact the bottom line of business.

Soul is a mindset shift. It’s a framework, a way of _building_.

We designed it from the ground up to be so, following a problem-first approach to solving and improving the DX of building a digital store, while retaining the great UX of a bespoke, world-class solution.

## Design-First Principles

Soul solves many problems with complex ecommerce website builds by breaking them down into self-contained components, each with its own state, error management, fallback UI, responsiveness, styles, and much more.

- Designed from day zero for localization and international usage.
- Everything is flexible. Soul adapts to visual and spatial needs of your content.
- Separate the design from the data. Keep them separate. Do not mix them until it’s time to display them.
- Abstract the brand theme from the interface. This ensures a high level of brand customization of fonts, colors, patterns like localization, streaming, PPR, fully prebuilt sections with props.
- No good examples online for encapsulating a design system so it’s easy for developers to use with their own ecommerce systems.
- Immutable interaction means that you can transplant the functionality of your store across different brands and visual treatments, without sacrificing usability.
