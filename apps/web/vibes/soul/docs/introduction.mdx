title: 'Welcome to Soul'
description: 'Building composable web solutions is like art: there are no rules, just countless mediums (technologies). It is within the eye of the artist (engineer) to ‘paint’ these technologies and bring them together into a cohesive product that is greater than the sum of its parts. This was the fundamental foundational principle of Soul — it’s an opinionated yet completely customizable set of components to help you build a proper store grounded in proper design.'
