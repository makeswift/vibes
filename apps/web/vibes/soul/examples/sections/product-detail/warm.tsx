    'Svelte and functional, this is one bag that goes well with every bike. We made this smaller so it fits little bikes and still carries the essentials - snacks, wallet, phone, keys, a tube, and tools. With multiple mounting positions, the fit can be dialed for short head-tubed mountain bikes, long stemmed road bikes, and everything in-between. The slim top edge is designed to fit behind mountain bike cables and tuck up neatly under computers, lights, and other accessories.',
